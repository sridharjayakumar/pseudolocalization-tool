[HtmlParser](http://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlparser/) is required for normal operation, and [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/) is required for the tests.

Compatible versions of both are provided in svn at [trunk/lib](http://pseudolocalization-tool.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lib/) or you can supply your own versions.

These are also packaged up in a `pseudolocalization-*-deps.jar` for convenience.
